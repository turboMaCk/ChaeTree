{-| Tree is list of nodes.
Tree is main data structure this package provides and this module implements the most essential functions
which really differs from general Rose Tree implementation. Along side with functor functions
trees support operation like `push`, `subTreeFor` and `fromList`. These functions make it easy to create
and manipulate trees only by knowing Ids of items.

-- Types


{-| Tree
-}
type alias Tree a =
    List (Node.Node a)


{-| Construct empty tree
Alias for []
-}
nil : Tree a
nil =
    []


{-| Map function over tree
Similar to `List.map` but working with trees
-}
map : (a -> Id) -> (a -> b) -> Tree a -> Tree b
map getId fc =
    List.map (Node.map getId fc)


{-| Map function over two trees to produce new tree from both combined
Similar to `List.map2` but working with trees
-}
map2 : (a -> b -> Id) -> (a -> b -> c) -> Tree a -> Tree b -> Tree c
map2 getId fc =
    List.map2 (Node.map2 getId fc)


{-| Zip two trees to tree of tuple
Similar to `List.zip` but working with trees
-}
zip : (a -> b -> Id) -> Tree a -> Tree b -> Tree ( a, b )
zip getId =
    map2 getId (,)


{-| Reduce Tree by given function
Similar to `List.foldl` but working with trees
-}
reduce : (a -> b -> b) -> b -> Tree a -> b
reduce reducer =
    List.foldl (flip (Node.reduce reducer))


{-| Filter Tree.
Similar to `List.filter` but working on trees.
If parent node do not pass condition its children are no included in result

    tree = [Node.node "5" 5 [ Node.singleton "1" 1, Node.singleton "10" 10 ] ]

    filter ((<) 4) tree == [Node "5" 5 ([Node "10" 10 []])]

    filter ((<) 0) tree == tree
